# WebAccountProvider Sample

[09/29/2016. Early work in progress]

In today's connected world where we constantly connect to great online services (like Facebook, Outlook.com, OneDrive, etc.), authentication is a frequent, yet necessary day-to-day task.  

There is some god infrastructure in-place (such as OAuth, Single Sign-On) to decrease the recurrent overhead for users who need to always be authenticated against a service.  Windows 8 introduced 
[WebAuthenticationBroker](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.authentication.web.webauthenticationbroker.aspx) to ease single sign-on for experiences on Windows. 

Windows 10 introduced [WebAccountManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.authentication.web.provider.webaccountmanager.aspx), which offers more flexible infrastructure around managing web accounts with system-wide integration (in Settings -> Email & App accounts), as well as communication between online properties (e.g. outlook.com or facebook.com) and their app counterparts (e.g. the Mail or Facbook App).  

Recently, I needed to share state between a website and an app, so I looked into the feature. I found the feature incredibly powerful, yet very undocumented.  I am not the ultimate expert for it*, but the feature was not that hard to code, so i hope the sample code included in this repo can bootstrap anyone looking to provide a single sign-on experience with WebAccountManager. 


*For more context on WebAccountManager and advise from real experts, here are the resources I know of:

- [Build 2015 Single Sign-on talk](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-709)


- Official [WebAccountManager](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/WebAccountManagement) sample, which shows you how to consume providers, but it misses the intricate how to write a [WebAccountProvider](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.credentials.webaccountprovider.aspx), which is what this sample demonstrates. 

Enough chat, let's get to the code. 

To leverage the WebAccountManager infrastructure, you just need to follow these steps: : 

1. Register your app  as a Web Account Provider.   
   You can do this in your apps package.appxmanifest. The entry point is a background task that will handle most silent operations.  
   <Extensions>
       <uap:Extension Category="windows.webAccountProvider">
             <uap:WebAccountProvider Url="https://paxwaptest.azurewebsites.net/" BackgroundEntryPoint="Saso.SampleProvider.BackgroundService.MainTask" />
           </uap:Extension>     
   </Extensions>

2. Implement the background task service to handle the different kinds of [WebAccountProviderOperationKind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.authentication.web.provider.webaccountprovideroperationkind.aspx) actions. The critical ones for the background task are RequestToken, GetTokenSilently, DeleteAccount, and RetrieveCookies.  The other operations such as AddAccount are not handled in the background task but in the app itself, via our next step.  

   The background service has few operations, but it should also manage your user account's lifecycle (such as authentication, retrieving, storing and securing tokens, etc.). My sample background task is Saso.SampleProvider.BackgroundService.MainTask and it does a naive, insecure and slightly incomplete implementation of account lifecycle management, but it does show all the different parameters and way to interact with WebAccountManager infrastructure as well as the right order for operations that are sequential - like adding an account into the system.  
   â€‹

3. Within your app, listen for the App's OnActivated event and handle the ActivationKind.WebAccountProvider scenario.  This is complementary to prior step, and here you should focus on the ones that need to show user interface -- such as AddAccount, ManageAccount-. 

Those are (in an over simplified nutshell) the steps required to implement an account provider.  



The next item to explain from our sample is how to leverage the WebAccountManager infrastructure to call into a provider.  There are many ways to call into a provider. Here i will call three:

1. Saso.SampleProvider.Client shows how to leverage WebAccountManager to locate a provider and call it showing UI and/or silently.  Try the sample and play with the infrastructure to see how WAM is launching the provider app (when UI is needed) or calling into the background service. 
2. You can also call into a WAP provider from within your app itself.  Imagine you are the Mail app, and need integration w/ live.com, within your app, you can use WAM infrastructure to handle your authentication, or pushing cookies to the web. 
3. You can also call from the web (IE and Edge) using the tbauth:// protocol handler. By just invoking it with your provider's id, the background service is called and you can pass information from the web into your provider using the query string parameters for the call.  You can also return information by pushing cookies to the web. 



[09/29/2016. More details coming soon. Interim, play with the code. There is plenty of docs on the interesting points]
